                <h3>About the work</h3>
                <p>Returning to nature is one of the effective forms of spiritual healing for many people. Studies have found that being in the forest can indeed help prevent cancer, fight obesity, reduce stress and treat depression (Yeon, 2021). Forest therapy allows people to go back to nature and breathe deeply, reducing sources of disturbance while inhaling a mixture of bioactive substances released by plants. One of these is called "terpenes", which are usually emitted from the thick bark of trees. When absorbed by the body, terpenes have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumourigenic and neuroprotective effects. I have therefore created a virtual 'forest therapy' to promote the use of nature for spiritual healing and to encourage more people to get out of the house and experience nature.</p>

                <h3>The work is presented in the following way</h3>
                <p>The participant clicks anywhere on the screen to create a number of trees by means of AR lens recognition. The forest has certain healing properties, and the results of experiments by Professor li at the Japanese Medical School showed that people who spent one day in the forest had more natural killer cells in their blood for the following week, while people who spent two or three days in the forest had high levels of natural killer cells for thirty days (Li , 2007). This implies that this form of spiritual healing is effective for human physical health.</p>
